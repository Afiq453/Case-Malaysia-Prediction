# Case Covid-19-Malaysia-Prediction
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the infectious disease known as coronavirus disease (COVID-19)also known as the coronavirus pandemic. The majority of those who contract the virus will suffer from mild to moderate respiratory illnesses and recover without the need for special care. The novel virus was first identified from an outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Attempts to contain it there failed, allowing the virus to spread worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 23 June 2022, the pandemic had caused more than 541 million cases and 6.32 million confirmed deaths, making it one of the deadliest in history. The lack of an AI-assisted automated tracking and prediction mechanism, according to the experts, is something that has led to the COVID-19 pandemic's rapid spread. Therefore, this project was build to create a deep learning model  to predict the covid-19 cases.
